    <string name="kasagiya">This Japanese confectionary near Kiyomizu Temple has been in business for 100 years. The interior has a traditional Japanese feel that hasn’t changed since the shop first opened. Just looking at some of the antique items used for years is a joy; some of these include an old black telephone, Japanese dolls, and an antique clock. The specialty here are ohagi. Delightfully sweet adzuki (red-bean paste) on the outside, with fluffy pounded rice on the inside, these ohagi go perfectly with matcha. We hope you’ll enjoy these all-hand-made sweets with no pre-made ingredients.

    <string name="nonameramen">There is no shortage of excellent restaurants in Central Kyoto, so it’s difficult for restaurants to stand out from the crowd these days. Nevertheless, this nameless ramen shop has managed to attract a steady flow of customers by the sheer quality of its ramen. I’ve been here several times now, and it’s definitely what you’d call a hidden gem.
    There’s no identifying sandwich board or signage, so you’ll need to find the staircase that leads to this restaurant, which is located on the basement floor of a building just off Kiyamachi Street. The staircase is nondescript, even slightly dingy-looking.
        Ramen is a quick, no-nonsense affair, and it doesn’t take long to arrive. But look: it is a thing of beauty. Ramen typically emphasizes meat and noodles, but I love that No Name pays equal attention and care to the vegetables that go into the bowl. The grilled negi (Japanese leek) which is included in the standard bowl, for instance, is an explosion of sweetness that almost brings tears to my eyes. A roasted cherry tomato tastes like pure summer. The beef cartilage is incredibly flavorful, so tender it collapses under my teeth. Uniting this noodle bowl is the broth, which here is a blend of thick and thin – with a little body and heft from the disintegrated bones, and deep, roasted chicken-y flavour. You could season it with a touch of sansho pepper if you like, but I already love it as it is.
It’s no surprise that little conversation takes place here, even with such chic, cafe-like surroundings which would normally encourage talking. This is a bowl of noodles that deserves your undivided attention.

    <string name="omen">Few restaurants manage to maintain high standards once they become immensely popular, but Omen has been doing it for years. The name means “noodles” and that’s their signature dish: thick udon noodles, served with either hot or cold broth. But there’s also a large a la carte menu with all kinds of excellent dishes to go with your noodles, usually made from seasonal ingredients. There’s comfortable tatami seating downstairs, along with a few counter seats that are good for solo diners, and table seating upstairs for inflexible foreigners. With an English menu and a welcoming staff, it’s no surprise that this place is a favorite of Kyoto’s long-term expat community. Just be warned: during cherry blossom season, the line for tables will be out the door.</string>

    <string name="takashimaya">While both of Kyoto’s main downtown department stores (Daimaru and Takashimaya) offer excellent resutoran-gai (restaurant floors), the one at Takashimaya gets the nod as the more elegant and better of the two.

Up on the 7th floor of the Takashimaya building (take the elevator), you’ll find all the major types of Japanese cuisine on offer here, as well as French, Italian and Chinese food. All told, it’s one of the best places to eat downtown, and most places aren’t too shocked by the appearance of the occasional foreigner.</string>
    <string name="tigergyoza">Not all meals have to be complicated. Gyoza, or dumplings, are as simple a meal as you can get when you eat out. Who could argue with pot stickers filled with all kinds of vegetables and meat? One of our favourite places in Kyoto to enjoy dumplings is at the Kawaramachi branch of Tiger Gyoza Kaikan.

Beloved by locals and tourists alike, the Tiger Gyoza chain is ever-reliable for their delicious dumplings and noodle dishes. Lunchtimes see a bargain set meal of gyoza, rice, pickles, and soup. At dinner, you’ll order a la carte. That’s our favourite thing to do, since it allows you to sample a wide range of dumplings.

We love the classic pan-fried gyoza, gorgeous plump crescents of juicy meat and alliums. Their lamb gyoza is one of their more unusual offerings, and well worth trying. Vegetarians should most definitely order the boiled green dumplings – contrary to all expectations, these are robustly flavoured, and they’ll have meat-lovers clamouring for seconds!

Besides the gyoza, we recommend sampling a few other dishes on Tiger Gyoza’s Chinese-inspired menu. The stir-fried green vegetables are a great way to get your daily dose of greens, while the Sichuan-style white sesame paste is flavourful and pleasantly spicy. While you could conceivably dine alone here, it’s best visited with a few people to be able to try as much of the menu as possible.</string>

1914 translation by H. Rackham
"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
